### What I do

I design and deploy technical systems across **robotics**, **machine learning**, and **MLOps/full-stack platforms**.

#### Robotics + Embodied AI
- Build end-to-end language-conditioned manipulation pipelines for real robots (7-DoF Sawyer).
- Translate VLM/VLA outputs into hierarchical, parameterized ROS2 action execution.
- Develop perception pipelines with RGB-D point clouds, open-vocabulary segmentation, 6-DoF pose estimation, and scene graph construction.
- Validate policies in simulation (Isaac Sim) with sim-to-real transfer workflows, including domain randomization and contact modeling.

#### AI Systems + MLOps
- Build and operate production AI services (frontend, backend APIs, auth, data, monitoring, deployment).
- Implement hybrid inference stacks combining deterministic computation with ML/LLM-assisted extraction and reasoning.
- Maintain release pipelines with regression checks, versioning, observability, and controlled rollouts.

#### Applied ML / Scientific Computing
- Work across Python, C++, and MATLAB for modeling, verification, and evaluation.
- Experience with computational-physics-oriented AI training/evaluation workflows (FEM/FDTD/BPM contexts).
