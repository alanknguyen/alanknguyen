## Profile

I work at the intersection of robotics, machine learning, and systems engineering:
- Language-conditioned manipulation on real robots (Sawyer, ROS2)
- Perception pipelines (RGB-D, open-vocabulary segmentation, pose estimation)
- AI platform engineering (API services, deployment, monitoring, CI/CD)
- Applied ML for scientific and real-world production environments

## Core Technical Areas

- **Embodied AI**: VLM/VLA planning, task decomposition, closed-loop execution
- **Robotics Systems**: ROS/ROS2, MoveIt2, Gazebo/Isaac Sim, sim-to-real workflows
- **ML Engineering**: PyTorch, classical ML, evaluation pipelines, inference services
- **Full-Stack + Infra**: React, Node/Express, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, AWS/Render

## Tech Stack

**Languages:** Python, C++, JavaScript, SQL, MATLAB  
**ML/DL:** PyTorch, scikit-learn, Hugging Face, NumPy, SciPy  
**Robotics:** ROS/ROS2, MoveIt2, OpenCV, Gazebo, MuJoCo, Isaac Sim  
**Infrastructure:** Docker, Git, CI/CD, observability, automated testing

## Current Interests

- Robust VLM/VLA manipulation under real-world uncertainty
- Planning + recovery for long-horizon robot tasks
- Benchmarking and evaluation for embodied AI systems
- Production-grade AI products with measurable impact
